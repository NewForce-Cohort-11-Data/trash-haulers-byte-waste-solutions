They should have been emptied yesterday (Wednesday)
Why is our alley not getting trash pickup?
Everyone has their trash in the brown trash cans like they're supposed to be.

Also, why do the trash workers have to leave such a mess in our alleys?
Why cant they put the cans back where they belong instead of just dumping them all over the alley after they have emptied them?
Cars cannot drive down the alley after the trash truck has been because the alley has cans all over the place.  They tip them over, they leave trash laying around that has dropped out as they are emptied.

I am on the Board of directors for our Homeowners Association. The driver is obviously bypassing our complex as it is evident the next day that individual homes with driveways with garbage cans all along the remainder of Golf Club Lane are picked up.   I am enclosing a photo of the sign for our complex on Golf Club Lane.   It is also terribly inefficient to follow Metro rules that every homeowner in Gloucester square report non-pick up of our trash when this happens.  It also means that no one in management is addressing the systemic issue here.  I have left voice mail messages for supervisor Marcus Jackson this morning and one  for a previous incident.    I would like some confirmation from management that this bigger issue is being addressed with the collection team that services our neighborhood.   I can be reached at 703-615-5949.

I am enclosing a photo of the sign for our complex on Golf Club Lane.   It is also terribly inefficient to follow Metro rules that every homeowner in Gloucester square report non-pick up of our trash when this happens.  It also means that no one in management is addressing the systemic issue here.  I have left voice mail messages for supervisor Marcus Jackson this morning and one  for a previous incident.

My trash is still here ( I'm disabled and it is difficult to take containers down my driveway.  When I went down today to pull it back up, I found my trash was not collected).  I called my next door neighbor and they stated their two containers were not emptied yesterday either.  I usually hear and see the trash truck go down our street and then come back up.  My neighbor indicated the same and neither of us saw or heard the truck yesterday.
The recycling truck DID come.thru and collect yesterday.
We have trash that carries odors and it is not good to have it sitting for another week.
If the truck will be coming around to collect, please have someone.call me so I'm able to get the container back down the driveway.

He emptied my next door neighbors can, He emptied the can across the street from where my cans were and he went up and down the streets emptying everyone's cans but mine.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I even watched him drive by my cans once when I was outside watching.  I stopped him on the way out of the neighborhood and asked the driver way he didn't empty mine.  His answer was ""Oh, I guess I didn't see them"".  Isn't that his job?  To look for cans at the curb so he can empty them.  My cans were at the curb, the view of them was not obstructed by vehicles, bushes or anything else.  The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.  Yeah Tuesday, because of the holiday I guess all pick up people are off.  If the cans are not picked up by Tuesday I'll be calling my councilman and asking for an investigation.
